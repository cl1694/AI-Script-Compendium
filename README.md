# AI-Script-Compendium
Here is a list of all script that is posted in `#ai-scripts` channel in the FSS Discord Server.

Doesn't include scripts for using skills in Tower Testing, since they should be paired with a certain bp to use.

Doesn't include scripts that is made to pair with another existing script.

Doesn't include scripts that I think is too useless. In other words, scripts that can be made in a minute, and don't work better than other similar scripts.

All scripts are sorted based on their category, then release date.

If you feel like your script should be added in the list, create a github issue with your script link(no export code).

### Script Special Tag List
- `Turbo vX`: Requires having the Turbo Exec vX pack imported and enabled.
- `Turbo vX Opt`: This script work without Turbo exec vX, but work faster if it is used.
- `Parallels`: This script accelerates itself by calling multiple instances of itself, faster than normal script but usually not as fast as turbo.
- `Turbo Own`: This script uses own build-in Turbo exec version to accelerate, therefore it isn't working with Turbo exec v1 enabled.
